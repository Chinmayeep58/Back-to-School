            Welcome to Back to School, as you would greet your students (or surprisingly to your teachers)<br>
            June, in India, is a month when it's time to pack the bags and get ready early in the morning for school.<br>
            That might sound a little boring, but worry not when we are here.<br><br>
            This is a platform where you could make your first day fun, interesting and most importantly less boring.
